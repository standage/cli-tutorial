This directory contains the LaTeX markup for the tutorial "Designing command-
line interfaces (CLIs) for scientific software". Additional source code included
in this directory is provided by way of example and does not immediately address
any real computing need.

To typeset this document, you will need the following.

  * a LaTeX distribution installed on your computer, particularly the 'pdflatex'
    command
  * the 'minted' package for LaTeX (see https://code.google.com/p/minted/),
    which in turn depends on the 'Pygments' syntax highlighting engine for
    Python
  * GNU make

If these dependencies are satisfied, you can typeset the document by entering
the command

  make

from the current directory in your terminal.
